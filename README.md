An app to record temperature and humidity data broadcast by an IOT device & send a text message notification if the humidity reading is outside of an [acceptable range](https://eu.steinway.com/en/dealer/south-africa/service/caring-for-your-steinway/).

[Here's a related Golang application](https://github.com/kellyi/ht_monitor) which runs on a Raspberry Pi Zero W & broadcasts sensor-derived temperature and humidity data across MQTT.
